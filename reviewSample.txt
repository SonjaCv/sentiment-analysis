 good battery life 
 it holds a decent charge i would think for a tablet .  
 so far , i 've been able to go nearly a full day on battery 
 and the battery life is much improved .  
 i wish samsung would have an option of removing their bloatware and custom menus .
 browser experience websites freezes 
 samsung does not make the best software , luckily being an android system these problems can be fixed .
 I would also recommend the larger screen size on this because I found this too small
 It's  heavy
 battery life is awesome 
 and has better battery life .

 yes , the samsung does have a card slot that can accept up to 128gb , but not everything transfers to these cards ( especially some apps ) and transfer rates from these cards are still slower than the included drive .

 keep up freezing the browser 
  I would also recommend the larger screen size on this because I found this too small
 i think it could be less heavy and faster
 I did not give it 5 stars because it is a little heavy

 amoled technology ( unlike more conventional lcd which powers ipad and every other tablet on the market ) does not rely on background lighting to assist display .  
 it 's superior to wqxga display in color saturation , depth of black color and overall brightness , which make the tablet best suited for watching blu-ray quality movies .  
 this is my first android tablet and i am absolutely blown away by the screen resolution !  
 crisp display
